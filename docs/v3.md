## Prepare data

### Raw dataset

#### DIV2K

Source: [homepage](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K).

File tree before compression:

```txt
div2k
`-- train
`   `-- 0{001,002,...,800}.png
`-- valid
    `-- 0{801,802,...,900}.png
```

#### Flickr2K

Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/limbee/NTIRE2017).

File tree before compression:

```txt
flickr2k
`-- 00{0001,0002,...,2650}.png
```

Flickr2K does not have a division into training and testing sets. During the compression, we create two annotation files for training and testing. The images with filenames `00{0001,...,1988}.png` are used for training, while `00{1989,...,2650}.png` are reserved for testing. For more details, please refer to the file `powerqe/tools/data/compress_img.py`.

#### Vimeo-90K

Source: [homepage](http://toflow.csail.mit.edu).

##### Triplet dataset

File tree before compression:

```txt
vimeo_triplet
`-- tri_trainlist.txt
`-- tri_testlist.txt
`-- sequences
    `-- 00001
    `   `-- 0001
    `   `   `-- im{1,2,3}.png
    `   `-- 0002
    `   `-- ...
    `   `-- 1000
    `-- 00002
    `-- ...
    `-- 00078
```

To shorten the validation time during training, we select 42 sequences (matched by `00001/*`) in `tri_testlist.txt` (3782 sequences in total) for validation and construct `tri_validlist.txt` for validation.

##### Septuplet dataset

File tree before compression:

```txt
vimeo_septuplet
`-- sep_trainlist.txt
`-- sep_testlist.txt
`-- sequences
    `-- 00001
    `   `-- 0001
    `   `   `-- im{1,2,...,7}.png
    `   `-- 0002
    `   `-- ...
    `   `-- 1000
    `-- 00002
    `-- ...
    `-- 00096
```

To shorten the validation time during training, we select 58 sequences (matched by `00001/*`) in `sep_testlist.txt` (7824 sequences in total) for validation and construct `sep_validlist.txt` for validation.

#### MFQEv2

Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0/wiki/MFQEv2-Dataset).

File tree before compression:

```txt
mfqev2_planar
`-- train
`   `-- 11skateboarding-10_1920x1080_87.yuv
`   `-- ...
`-- test
    `-- BQMall_832x480_600.yuv
    `-- ...
```

Unlike the Vimeo-90K dataset, which consists of images, the MFQEv2 dataset consists of planar files. Consequently, the ground truth (GT) images will be generated from these planar files using the YCbCr 420P to RGB24 conversion during compression.

Moreover, each sequence in the MFQEv2 dataset contains a varying number of images. We generate a maximum of 300 images from each planar file.

The minimum patch size for all video datasets should not be smaller than 256, as it is required by BasicVSR++. We filter out videos from the training set if their height or width is smaller than 256.

Also, we filter out `Traffic_2560x1600_150` and `PeopleOnStreet_2560x1600_150` for testing since they are too big for most types of GPU.

### Compression

#### BPG

[Better Portable Graphics (BPG)](https://bellard.org/bpg) is a image format based on the intra-frame encoding of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard.

Please refer to the official site and the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/mirrorer/libbpg/blob/master/README) for instructions. The following is my personal experience of using libbpg v0.9.8.

##### Build

Clone:

```bash
cd data
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mirrorer/libbpg.git libbpg
```

Modify `libbpg/Makefile`:

- Comment `USE_X265=y` and uncomment `USE_JCTVC=y`: We want to use JCTVC instead of x265.
- Comment `USE_BPGVIEW=y`: We do not need BPGView.

Build:

```bash
cd data/libbpg
make clean
make
```

There may be errors during the build. We need to install the required dependencies according to the error messages. For examples,

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

# build again
make clean
make
```

Basic usage:

```bash
bpgenc [-q quality] -o bpg_path src_path  # src image -> bpg
bpgdec -o tar_path bpg_path  # bpg -> tar image
```

Check `bpgenc -h` and `bpgdec -h` for detailed usage.

##### Example: Compress the DIV2K dataset

Run:

```bash
conda activate pqe &&\
 python tools/data/compress_img.py --codec bpg --dataset div2k
```

Resulting file tree:

```txt
powerqe
`-- data
`   `-- libbpg
`   `   `-- bpgdec
`   `   `-- bpgenc
`   `-- {div2k,div2k_lq/bpg/qp37}
`       `-- train
`       `   `-- 0{001,002,...,800}.png
`       `-- valid
`           `-- 0{801,802,...,900}.png
`-- tmp/div2k_lq/bpg/qp37  # can be deleted after compression
    `-- train
    `   `-- 0{001,002,...,800}.bpg
    `-- valid
        `-- 0{801,802,...,900}.bpg
```

#### HM

[HM](https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/HM) is the reference software for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).

Please refer to the official site and the document (e.g., `HM/doc/software-manual.pdf`) for instructions. The following is my personal experience of using HM 18.0.

##### Build

```bash
cd data
git clone -b HM-18.0 --depth=1 https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/HM.git hm18.0

cd hm18.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j
```

##### Example: Compress the Vimeo-90K triplet dataset

```bash
conda activate pqe &&\
 python tools/data/compress_video.py\
 --dataset vimeo-triplet
```

Resulting file tree:

```txt
powerqe
`-- data
`   `-- hm18.0

```

## Others

### Configuration

#### Obtain clean configuration without inheritance

Configuration inheritance is widely used in PowerQE to ensure consistency among configurations.

To obtain clean configuration without inheritance:

```bash
conda activate pqe
python -c "from mmcv import Config; cfg = Config.fromfile('configs/arcnn/div2k_lmdb.py'); print(cfg.pretty_text)"
```

#### Crop image border before evaluation

Due to the padding of upsampling, the error at borders is significant. PowerQE follows the common practice in MMEditing to crop image borders before evaluation.

#### Test time unfolding

When using test time unfolding, patch-based evaluation is conducted to save memory. The accuracy may also drop.

### Data

#### What are key frames

Some approaches such as MFQEv2[^mfqev2] take advantage of the frame-wise quality fluctuation caused by the QP offset. We consider key frames as those with the lowest QP locally. Note that we do not consider PSNR since it also correlates to the content, while QP only correlates to the compression. This strategy is effective for low-delay P configuration, which turns off the rate control and fixes QP.

You can find `QP`, `IntraQPOffset`, `QPoffset`, `QPOffsetModelOff`, and `QPOffsetModelScale` in the configuration, i.e., `data/hm18.0/cfg/encoder_lowdelay_P_main.cfg`. In addition, you can find the frame QPs in log files. How do `QP`, `IntraQPOffset`, `QPoffset`, `QPOffsetModelOff`, and `QPOffsetModelScale` determine the final frame QPs?

- POC 0 (I-SLICE): `QP + IntraQPOffset`
- POC 1, 2, ... (P-SLICE): `QP + QPoffset + QPOffsetModelOff + QPOffsetModelScale * QP`

For example, the `QP`, `IntraQPOffset`, `QPoffset`, `QPOffsetModelOff`, and `QPOffsetModelScale` are `37`, `-1`, `[5,4,5,4,5,4,5,1]`, `[-6.5,...,-6.5,0]`, and `[0.2590,...,0.2590,0]`, respectively. Then, QP values for POC 0 to 8 are `36`, `45`, `44`, `45`, `44`, `45`, `44`, `45`, and `38`, respectively. Since a lower QP correlates to higher compression quality, POC 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 are key frames.

> The configuration can vary among different HM versions. In HM 16.5, QP offsets are set to `[5,4,5,1]` (GOPSize: 4).

> You can also find a configuration with GOPSize being 4 for HM 18.0 at `data/hm18.0/cfg/misc/encoder_lowdelay_P_main_GOP4.cfg`.

#### Use LMDB for faster IO

LMDB can be effectively utilized to accelerate IO operations, particularly for storing training patches.

Pros:

- Improved training speed: By working with small patches instead of larger images, the training process can be significantly expedited.
- Reduced CPU and GPU resource usage: Processing smaller patches instead of entire images alleviates the burden on both the CPU and GPU, resulting in lower CPU utilization and reduced GPU memory consumption.
- Universal image format: LMDB allows storing all images, such as PNG, JPG, and others, as PNG format within the LMDB files.
- Consolidated patch storage: All training patches are conveniently packed into a single LMDB file, facilitating organization and access.

Cons:

- Increased memory requirements: Prior to training, the LMDB files need to be loaded into memory, which can result in higher memory usage compared to directly working with images.
- Additional time, computation, and storage for generating LMDB files.
- Fixed cropping method: Once the LMDB file is generated, the cropping method employed for extracting patches from images becomes fixed and cannot be easily modified without regenerating the LMDB file.

Run for the DIV2K dataset:

```bash
conda activate pqe &&\
 python tools/data/prepare_dataset.py\
 --dataset div2k
```

Resulting file tree:

```txt
powerqe
`-- data/lmdb
    `-- div2k/train.lmdb
    `-- div2k_lq/bpg/qp37/train.lmdb
`-- tmp/patches  # can be deleted
    `-- div2k/train
    `-- div2k_lq/bpg/qp37/train
```

For the configuration file with LMDB loading, see `configs/arcnn/div2k_lmdb.py`.

#### Why do we not use x265

[x265](https://www.x265.org) is a HEVC video encoder application library. Encoding videos using x265 can be much faster than using HM. x265 has been supported by FFmpeg with [libx265](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265). As indicated by this paper[^paper-x265], the following script can generate compressed videos that closely resemble the output of HM:

```bash
ffmpeg -video_size <WIDTH>x<HEIGHT>\
 -i <INPUT>\
 -vcodec libx265\
 -qp <QP>\
 -x265-params <OPTIONS>\
 <OUTPUT>
```

for options:

```bash
<OPTIONS>=
keyint=7:min-keyint=7:no-scenecut:me=full:subme=7:bframes=0:qp=<QP>
```

For research purpose, we need to control the distortion. Therefore, it is better to use a specific configuration of a stable version of the reference software. For example, we may use the [low-delay P](https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/HM/-/blob/fb4486d5ab5d0cd3b6a71659c7d5eb4509f2a4ce/cfg/encoder_lowdelay_P_main.cfg) configuration of HM 18.0 to compress videos. In this configuration, many hyperparameters, including the frame-level QP offset, are set. The above script does not indicate these parameters.

> The QP offset is proposed to achieve better RD performance[^qp-offset]. Some approaches such as MFQEv2[^mfqev2] take advantage of the frame-wise quality fluctuation caused by the QP offset.

#### Use BPG on Mac

First install libbpg via homebrew:

```bash
brew install libbpg
#brew list
```

Then replace the `BPGENC_PATH` and `BPGDEC_PATH` in the script `tools/data/compress_video.py`:

```bash
BPGENC_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/bpgenc"
BPGDEC_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/bpgdec"
```

Finally run the Bash script.

### Framework

#### Use pre-commit hook for code check

PowerQE follows [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and MMEditing to support the pre-commit hook. Installation:

```bash
conda activate pqe
pip install -U pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

On every commit, linters and formatter will be enforced. You can also run hooks manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all
```

### Doc

#### Markdown heading text anchors

For example, the anchor (ID) of this paragraph is `markdown-paragraph-id`. One can jump from another Markdown file to this paragraph by `docs/develop.md#markdown-paragraph-id`.

Note that Markdown will convert the heading text to lowercase, remove any non-alphanumeric characters, and replace spaces with hyphens. For example, if we have two paragraphs named `Markdown paragraph: ID` and `Markdown paragraph ID`, their corresponding IDs will be `#markdown-paragraph-id` and `#markdown-paragraph-id-1`, respectively.

It's worth noting that the exact algorithm for generating the unique identifier can vary between Markdown renderers and may depend on the specific implementation details of the renderer. We may check ID by GitHub or VS Code TOC.

### Principle

- Do not refactor the code arbitrarily; as long as the original code can achieve the desired functionality, it is sufficient.
- Focus on new features and new architectures; only new things have high value.
